# Prototype

    getting behaviours and properties from parent class to child class called as Prototype chaining.

# Constructor Functions

    in javascript (below ES6 version), we will create "classes" by using "constructor" functions.

    In constructor function all the members (variables & functions) starts with "this" keyword.

    we will create the object to the classes by using "new" keyword.

> node prototype.js

    execute the js code.

before ES6 how to create class ? Using function

class is combination of variables and methods.

- Add variable dynamically to constructor functions.

What is Prototype? Add dynamic members to constructor functions.

## MultiLevel Inheritance

class1 , class2, class3

### Multiple inheritance is not supported by Javascript

## Overriding

- parent class functionality overiding with child class functionality
